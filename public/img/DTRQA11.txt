Is Paige getting a tattoo evidence that she is leaving the company soon?

The logic behind the assumption is that Paige would have never gotten such a tattoo if she were staying with the company out of fear of the heat she would get backstage. However, we have no way of knowing that she wouldn't have gotten the tattoo regardless, especially considering that Del Rio no longer works for the company and that they're relationship probably will not give her the kind of heat that it once did when he was still there. She might have taken the picture down because deep down she knows how stupid tatooing the name of someone you've only been dating for 9 months on yourself is stupid and clingy and she was embarrassed by it.

Given what we know, is it possible that Paige could be on her way out but has not yet officially told the company?

Sure, that's possible. It's possible that she might not want to leave until a set later date so not telling the WWE would make it so that they don't change her creative in anticipation of her departure. It also could be that she doesn't want to drop the news about her departure until later because she wants to make her mind up completely before committing to anything.

Is Paige not being scheduled for anything after her suspension evidence that she is on her way out?

It would be considered evidence but certainly not conclusive evidence.


If Paige does leave, do you think she'd wrestle again?

Probably. Ever or never is a long time, especially at 24 yrs old. She doesn't seem to have other interests in her life like writing a book or rescuing dogs like AJ Lee does and it doesn't look like she's adopted a hobby like that. Plus it's harder for her to get away from it as her family still does it.
